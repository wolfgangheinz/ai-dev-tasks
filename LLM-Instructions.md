# Bandcamp Wishlist Explorer â€” Functional Specification (PRD/PRP)

## Instructions for ChatGPT and other LLMs
1. When asked to create a plan for a feature append the plan at the end without changing anything in the file
2. When asked to update the specification (after a feature was implemented)
    - DO NOT DELETE any content before the # Backlog tag. 
    - You can UPDATE individual items in case they are directly describing the feature that that needs to be changed
    - DELETE the relevant feature or implementation plan (after the # Backlog tag)
3. When asked to think about new use cases or features append only the list "## Additional suggestions from ChatGPT" with new ideas
4. Always try to patch the file directly. In case this fails, give very detailed instructions and ideally provide the full blocks/functions that need to be deleted or changed.
5. Remember that ChatGPT or some other LLMs can only pair one file at a tile. Always state which file needs to be paired next to proceed. 
6. Whenever possible, make sure that existing likes and dislikes are preserved. No update we do should create a situation where all existing likes are lost. 
7. Whenever it's helpful, ask up to 5 clarifying questions before you proceed to make sure the requirements are clear.
8. After every code change please suggest a commit message
